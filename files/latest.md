other than as a result of breach of this agreement, ceases to be

Information, unless the disclosure breached a confidentiality obligation
to Disclosing Party that Disclosing Party made known to Receiving Party.

Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall bear the burden
of proving independent development using contemporaneous documentary
evidence.

> Purpose; and

> (B)have entered written confidentiality agreements with Receiving
> Party that impose confidentiality obligations, affording as much or
> more protection as those of this agreement, that apply to the
> Confidential Information; and

under confidentiality obligations imposed either by law or by
professional rules ("**Advisers**").

> (c)**Limited Use**. Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information
> only to advance the Purpose.

> laws by dealing in securities of Disclosing Party.

> (g)**No Reverse Engineering**. Receiving Party shall not reverse

Disclosing Party in any such proceeding by providing reasonable

> anticipates that Confidential Information has been or will be
> disclosed or used in breach of this agreement or other confidentiality
> agreements with Disclosing Party.

(i)Subject to *Section 4(k)* (Records Policy), when this agreement
terminates, Receiving Party shall promptly:

> (A)return all materials embodying Confidential Information that
> Disclosing Party provided with request to return; and

> (B)destroy all parts of other materials that embody Confidential
> Information.

> (k)**Records Policy**. When this agreement terminates, if Receiving
