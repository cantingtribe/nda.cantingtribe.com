        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <h3 id=special>What’s so special about these NDA terms?</h3>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The Canting Tribe NDA differs from other NDAs only in how it protects everyone from having to read it over and over again.  Every copy of The Canting Tribe NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing it, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.  The license for the terms requires those who make changes to drop the name “The Canting Tribe NDA” from their changed versions.</p>

        <h3 id=kind>What kind of NDA is this?</h3>
        <p>These terms are typical of the kinds of terms companies sign before discussing sales, partnerships, and other relatively routine business transactions.</p>
        <p>These terms are <em>not</em> typical of terms companies sign with other companies before mergers-and-acquisitions due diligence or other infrequent, specialized deals.</p>

        <h3 id=improve>Will these terms improve over time?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  When we find a way to improve 1.0.0, we’ll call it 1.0.1, or 2.0.0, or 55.44.321.  Anything but 1.0.0 again.  Version 1.0.0 always be the same.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <p>If you’s like an e-mail every time a new version comes out, <a href="mailto:kyle@cantingtribe.com?subject=Canting%20Tribe%20NDA%20Updates%20List">e-mail kyle@cantingtribe.com</a> and ask to be added to the mailing list.</p>

        <h3 id=lawyers>Did lawyers write and review this?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  But they are not your lawyers, or responsible to you for legal advice.</p>
        <p>You should have your lawyer review and approve the most recent version.  They can tell you whether and when The Canting Tribe NDA is right for your company.</p>
        <p>If your lawyer has comments, feel free to have them e-mail <a href=mailto:comments@cantingtribe.com>comments@cantingtribe.com</a>.  We can and will incorporate feedback.</p>

        <h3 id=abroad>Does this NDA work outside the USA?</h3>
        <p>These terms were written with USA-based parties in mind, and require the party proposing the NDA to pick a state of the United States for governing law.</p>
        <p>We’d love to receive comments on whether and how to make it work with other jurisdictions, at <a href=mailto:comments@cantingtribe.com>comments@cantingtribe.com</a>.</p>
